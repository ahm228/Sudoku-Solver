This program provides functionalities for generating Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties and solving them. It uses a backtracking algorithm to ensure valid puzzle generation and solution. Here's an overview of how the code works:
Features

    Dynamic Board Sizes: This program supports Sudoku boards of different sizes, provided they are perfect squares (e.g., 4x4, 9x9, 16x16).
    Difficulty Levels: Users can specify the difficulty of the generated Sudoku puzzle. The difficulty level determines the number of filled cells removed from the completed board.
    Manual Puzzle Solving: Users have the option to solve the generated puzzle manually.
    Auto Solve: If a user chooses not to solve the puzzle manually, the program will solve it automatically using a backtracking algorithm.

Core Functions

    isValid(num, row, col): Checks if a number can be placed in a specific cell without violating Sudoku rules.
    placeNumber(board, num, row, col): Places a number in a cell and updates row, column, and box trackers.
    removeNumber(board, row, col): Removes a number from a cell and updates row, column, and box trackers.
    solve(board): Recursively tries to solve the board using the backtracking algorithm.
    findEmptyCell(board): Finds the first empty cell on the board.
    printBoard(board): Prints the Sudoku board in a user-friendly format.
    generateSudoku(difficulty): Generates a Sudoku puzzle based on a specified difficulty.
    getUserInput(): Gets user input for board size and difficulty level.
    userMove(board): Allows the user to make moves while solving the puzzle manually.

Usage

To use the program:

    Run the code.
    Enter the desired board size (e.g., 9 for a 9x9 board).
    Specify the difficulty level (0 to 1, where 1 is the hardest).
    The program will display the generated Sudoku puzzle.
    Choose whether you'd like to solve the puzzle manually or let the program solve it.

Example
    Enter board size (e.g., 9 for a 9x9 board): 9
    Enter difficulty (0 to 1, where 1 is hardest): 0.5
    Initial unsolved board:
    ...
    Would you like to solve the puzzle yourself? (yes/no): yes
    ...

Enter board size (e.g., 9 for a 9x9 board): 9
Enter difficulty (0 to 1, where 1 is hardest): 0.5
Initial unsolved board:

Note

    This Sudoku generator uses randomization for both the puzzle generation and solution processes. As a result, the puzzles and their solutions can differ each time you run the program.
    The difficulty level determines how many cells are removed from a fully solved board to create the puzzle. A difficulty of 1 will be extremely challenging, while a difficulty of 0 will provide a completely filled board.

Dependencies

This program relies on Python's built-in random module. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed to run this code.
